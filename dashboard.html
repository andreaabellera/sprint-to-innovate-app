    <h2>2. Budgeting and Saving</h2>
    <p>The first step to achieve anything in life is to identify the problem, and then to brainstorm solutions.</p> 

    <p>Budgeting and tracking your expenses would help you to identify where you might be overspending, and hence where you could start saving some money.</p>
    <p>We understand budgeting can sound daunting, but using our integrated TOOL, it will be a breeze!</p>
    <p>You should start off by identifying the necessary costs which could include things like:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rent/mortgage, utilities</li>
      <li>Groceries</li>
      <li>Utilities</li>
      <li>Personal hygiene and health</li>
      <li>Income earning expenses (such as transport)</li>
      <li>Taxes</li>
      <li>Minimum payment on all debts</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Debt, Credit Scores and Emergency Funds</h2>
    <p>Debt generally refers to the amount that one party might owe to another, whether it is between people or corporations. Debt always comes along with an interest rate, which means you need to pay back the original amount + the interest that has accumulated. Common forms of debt include car loans, mortgages and credit cards.</p>
    <p>(PSSST! You can use our TOOL to set a savings goal to pay off your debts!)</p>
    <p>Canadian corporations measure your general ability to pay back debt using credit scores, and the corporations responsible for this are mainly Equifax and TransUnion. Credit scores are great because they can help businesses to determine the best candidates to give loans to! But it also means you need to maintain your credit history by making timely payments</p>
    <p>This brings us to our last topic for this lesson, Emergency Funds. Life is very unpredictable and it is very important to maintain some savings for those rough times that might come by. It is generally recommended to have 3-6 months of monthly expenses in your emergency fund. It can really help you get out of a tough time, so it's good to have. You can use the TOOL to save up for it effectively!</p>
    <p>That's all for this lesson, congratulations on making it so far! You are taking great steps towards better financial decisions and with our help you will be there in no time!</p>

    <h2>4. Line of Credit</h2>
    <p> A Line of Credit (LOC) is basically a fixed limit of the amount of money you can borrow from an institution when you require it. Everything ranging from a credit card to mortgages to business loans can be classified as a line of credit.</p>
    <p>As discussed in the previous lesson, credit scores are important as they help an institution determine your ability to repay borrowed money, and consider it before extending you a line of credit. That is why it is important to maintain a good credit score if you plan on borrowing money for a big purchase or starting a business some time in the future</p>

    <h2>5. The Power of Investing</h2>
    <p>Investing, in simple words, is when you allocate some of your financial resources today with the goal of eventually generating a profit or income sometime in the future. Simple right?</p>
    <p>Buying a house at $200,000 today and selling it for $300,000 in a few years is an investment, and so is buying some stock in a company which goes from being worth $1000 to $1500 in a few months.</p>
    <p>The field of investing is very wide and diverse, and quite frankly can be very confusing. Thatâ€™s ok, access credit union has your back. Our educational modules will further help you understand these concepts, and you could also try our <b>STOCK SIMULATOR TOOL</b> to help get an idea of how the financial markets work.</p>
    <p>The following list gives you an idea of all the potential investment methods: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Bonds</li>
      <li>Stocks</li>
      <li>Real Estate</li>

    <h2>7. What is a Credit Union?</h2>
    <p>A credit union is similar to a bank in the sense that you can deposit and withdraw money using chequing and savings accounts, access a diverse range of investment options and apply for loans and mortgages.</p>
    <p>There is one huge difference though, at credit unions you are not just a customer but a shareholder! Credit unions are cooperatives with the primary goal of serving their customers as members, thus ensuring a better overall customer experience.</p>
    <p>Just like banks, credit unions are regulated and deposits are insured.</p>

  <header-message>Investing for a House</header-message>
  <div class="card">
    <h2>Buying New House</h2>
    <p>Buying a house can both be exciting and scary at the same time. We have put in a few questions you should ask to guide yourself through this process:</p>
    <h6>Can you afford a Down Payment? </h6>
    <p>Down Payments are a fixed percentage of the cost of the home you want to buy which has to be paid up front. Your credit score and your history with the bank shall be considered in determining the amount of downpayment. Down Payments are at least 5%, and can turn into large amounts.</p>

    <h6>Do you have a steady cash in flow?</h6>
    <p>Mortgages are long term commitments and you want to make sure you are in a position of financial security before you decide to look for houses. It is recommended to spend no more than 30% of your income on housing costs including rent, insurance etc.</p>

    <h6>Opportunity Costs ?</h6>
    <p>Buying a house at some point is definitely a life goal for most people, but you need to consider if you might be letting go of some better opportunities by spending that money on purchasing a house</p>
    <p>For example, you might be able to live with your parents for a few years paying no or very little rent, and although you could buy a house, the opportunity cost would be the potential of saving all that money and possibly investing it into something else.</p>

    <h6>What is the size of the house?</h6>
    <p>How large is your family, how many dependents do you have to take care of etc. are things you need to consider. All of us want to live in big mansions with 10 bedrooms, but is it really a wise financial choice?</p>
    <p>These are just some of the questions to ask yourself, and it is important to think things through carefully and understand all the terms of the mortgage agreement before buying a house.</p>

  <div class="card">
  <h2>Starting a Business</h2>
  <p>Starting a business is a great choice and offers a high potential for rewards. But it can be quite overwhelming and we want to provide a starting point for you. You need to test the viability of your business idea before you actually jump in.</p>
  
  <h6>Demand and Supply</h6>
  <p>Are there enough customers to buy your product, is it something that they are looking for? That's the demand. Is there a lack of similar businesses trying to fulfill the demand of customers, leading to the excess demand in the first place? That is Supply, or more like the lack of Supply. 
    In the best case scenario, <b>Demand > Supply</b> </p>
    
  <h6>What Form of Buisness</h6>
  <p>There are three main types of business organizations in Canada</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Sole Proprietorship : Very simple in structure and can be set up within one day!</li>
      <li>Partnership : A more complex form of a sole proprietorship and includes more than one owner</li>
      <li>Corporation : The most sophisticated type of business organization with multiple owners and separation of ownership and business liability. Multiple owners with shares/stock</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h6>Capital</h6>
    <p>Starting a business requires funds, and more often than not new entrepreneurs would require a loan initially. It is important to know that credit unions and banks can offer loans to you. At Access Credit Union, we highly value our customers particularly small business owners and you can check our site and contact us for more information! Besides loans, you could also take advantage of our business accounts</p>

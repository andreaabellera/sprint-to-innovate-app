## Challenge Description
How do we foster meaningful banking relations with Generation Z? What digital banking/financial technology mechanisms should we introduce and/or what traditional banking practices or products do we need to adapt?

## Deliverables
### Prototype

## Note on Role Distribution
Bringing the prototype to life is a big thanks to my teammates Scott, Tano(Khuc), and Saksham who collaborated on VSCode Live Share. I did **not** contribute code to the prototype, only some UI design and graphic assets. My focus has been on the data/business aspect with Qasim.
